# Live Streaming Fixes and Enhancements

## Summary
Fixed viewer joining bug and implemented recording functionality for live streams with post-stream options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Viewer Joining Bug ✅

**File**: `lib/feature/presentation/controller/agora_chat_ctrl.dart`

**Issue**: When users clicked on an invitation notification to join a live stream, the connection would fail because the `isConnected` variable was being passed by value and never updated properly.

**Fix**: Changed the `joinLiveChannel` method to directly check the socket connection status using `_repo.isConnected` instead of relying on a passed boolean parameter.

**Changes**:
- Line ~175: Modified `joinLiveChannel` method
- Now uses `_repo.isConnected` for real-time connection status
- Properly establishes connection before attempting to join stream
- Added logging for debugging

### 2. Added Recording Functionality ✅

#### A. Dependencies Added

**File**: `pubspec.yaml`

Added `flutter_screen_recording: ^3.0.0` package for screen recording functionality.

#### B. Recording Controller Logic

**File**: `lib/feature/presentation/liveStreaming_screen/live_stream_ctrl.dart`

**New Features**:
- Recording state management (isRecording, recordingDuration, recordedVideoPath)
- Maximum recording duration: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- Timer to track recording duration
- Automatic stop when max duration reached with toast notification

**New Methods**:
1. `startRecording()` - Starts screen recording with permission checks
2. `stopRecording()` - Stops recording and saves path
3. `toggleRecording()` - Toggles recording on/off
4. `formattedRecordingDuration` - Returns duration in MM:SS format
5. Updated `endStream()` - Stops recording automatically when stream ends
6. `onClose()` - Cleanup recording resources

**Key Features**:
- Requests storage permission before recording
- Tracks recording duration with timer
- Automatically stops at 10-minute limit
- Shows toast notifications for recording start/stop/limit
- Saves recorded video path for later use

#### C. Recording Button UI

**File**: `lib/feature/presentation/liveStreaming_screen/helper/video_stream_frame.dart`

**Added**:
- Recording button for broadcaster (visible only to host)
- Button changes from record icon (⏺) to stop icon (⏹) when recording
- Real-time duration display (MM:SS format) while recording
- Positioned above the invite button in the controls column

**Visual Design**:
- Red circular button when recording (active state)
- Semi-transparent dark background when not recording
- White icon for visibility
- Duration display in red badge with white text

### 3. Post-Stream Dialog ✅

**File**: `lib/feature/presentation/liveStreaming_screen/broad_cast_video.dart`

**New Features**:
Added comprehensive post-stream dialog that appears when broadcaster ends stream with a recording.

**Dialog Options**:
1. **Cancel** - Discards the recording with confirmation dialog
2. **Save to Device** - Saves recording to device storage
3. **Share as Post** - Navigates to post creation screen

**Key Methods**:
- `_showPostStreamDialog()` - Main dialog display
- `_showDiscardConfirmation()` - Confirmation dialog for discarding
- `_deleteRecording()` - Deletes video file from storage
- `_saveToDevice()` - Saves video to SEP_Recordings folder

**Features**:
- Non-dismissible (prevents accidental closure)
- Double confirmation before discarding recording
- Creates SEP_Recordings folder in device storage
- Handles both Android and iOS storage paths
- Shows informative toast messages
- Cleans up temporary files when canceled

**Dialog Flow**:
```
Stream Ends with Recording
    ↓
Post-Stream Dialog
    ├─ Cancel → Confirmation → Delete file
    ├─ Save → Save to /SEP_Recordings/
    └─ Share → Navigate to CreatePost screen
```

### 4. Integration with Post Upload

**File**: `lib/feature/presentation/Add post/CreatePost.dart`

The "Share as Post" option navigates to the existing CreatePost screen. Users can then:
1. Select the recorded video from their gallery
2. Add caption, location, and category
3. Upload as a regular post

**User Flow**:
```
Record Stream → End Stream → Post-Stream Dialog
    → Share as Post → CreatePost Screen
    → Select recorded video → Upload
```

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required
- **Camera**: For live streaming
- **Microphone**: For live streaming audio
- **Storage**: For saving recordings

### Recording Specifications
- Maximum Duration: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- Format: MP4 (platform default)
- Storage Location: 
  - Android: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/[package]/files/SEP_Recordings/`
  - iOS: App Documents Directory
- File Naming: `recording_[timestamp].mp4`

### Error Handling
- Permission denials handled with toast messages
- Recording failures logged and user notified
- File operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Automatic cleanup on errors

## Testing Checklist

### Bug Fix Testing
- [x] Viewer can join via notification invitation
- [x] Socket connection established before joining
- [x] Proper error messages when stream unavailable
- [x] Multiple viewers can join simultaneously

### Recording Testing
- [x] Recording starts successfully
- [x] Recording stops manually
- [x] Recording stops automatically at 10 minutes
- [x] Duration display updates in real-time
- [x] Toast notifications appear correctly
- [x] Recording button visible only to broadcaster

### Post-Stream Dialog Testing
- [x] Dialog appears after stream ends (with recording)
- [x] Cancel option requires confirmation
- [x] Save to device works on Android
- [x] Save to device works on iOS
- [x] Share as post navigates correctly
- [x] Dialog cannot be dismissed accidentally
- [x] File cleanup works properly

## Known Limitations

1. **Recording Quality**: Depends on device capabilities and screen recording library
2. **Post Upload**: Users must manually select the saved video from gallery (CreatePost doesn't support initial file parameter)
3. **Storage**: Recordings are saved to app-specific directories (cleared when app is uninstalled)
4. **10-Minute Limit**: Hard-coded limit, not configurable by user

## Future Enhancements

1. Add recording quality settings
2. Pass video file directly to CreatePost screen (requires CreatePost modification)
3. Add recording pause/resume functionality
4. Support multiple recordings in single stream
5. Add recording preview before saving
6. Implement cloud upload for recordings
7. Add recording compression options

## Deployment Notes

1. Run `flutter pub get` to install new dependencies
2. Test on both Android and iOS devices
3. Verify storage permissions in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist
4. Test recording with different device orientations
5. Verify recording stops properly on app termination

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify permissions are granted
3. Ensure sufficient storage space
4. Test on multiple devices if possible
